# Delivery Improvement System
For a certain university, deliveries of packages have been arriving late to their desired location. This has caused numerous issues and is in need of fixing via an algorithmic 
solution that finds a more ideal delivery route for the university's post office trucks.

# Main Challenge
This problem is a variation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which is known to be NP-Hard. The goal of this program is not necessarily to solve the problem as ideally as possible 
(which would be an incredible feat), but to simply find a single solution that is as ideal as necessary for the delivery of the packages to be considered "efficient" and "on-time".

# Lessons Learned
- Creating and implementing a hash table data structure to improve search and insert functionality amongst the program
- Abstraction of real-world concepts into code-based objects to implement Object Oriented Programming
- Implementation of a Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, as a potential solution to this version of the TSP Problem
